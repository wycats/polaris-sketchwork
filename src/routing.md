At a 20,000 foot view, the idea is to turn the route into a component that gets `params` from the router, turn the `model` hook into a resource that returns `AsyncData`, and turn the substate feature into a `#match` on that data.

This document will soon be updated to describe the routing proposal in detail.

In the meantime, resources are described in detail in the [reactivity](./reactivity.md) section. `#match` is described in the [match](./match.md) proposal, and the end of that proposal has a detailed sketch of the basic idea of `AsyncData` and how it could be used in routing.
